    <h1>What is it?</h1>

    <p><strong>Flowtime.js</strong> is a framework for easily building HTML presentations or websites.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s built with web standards in mind and on top of a solid full page grid layout.</p>

    <p>The animations are managed with native and accelerated CSS3 transitions.<br>
      Javascript takes care of the navigation behaviour and adds advanced functionalities and configuration options.
    </p>

    <p>Press <strong>Down Key</strong> or <strong>Swipe Up</strong> to continue.</p>

    <h1>Compatibility and Support</h1>

    <p><strong>Flowtime.js</strong> is fully compatible with real moderns browsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox</li>
      <li>Chrome</li>
      <li>Safari</li>
      <li>Opera</li>
      <li>Internet Explorer 10</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Internet Explorer 9 and some old versions of other browsers lack the transitions and some modern Javascript
      features but the main navigation and functionalities will work.</p>

    <p>In older browsers degrades to a bi-directional scrolling navigation with anchor links.</p>
